Semantic colorscheme 
=====================

this colorscheme comes from https://github.com/Kuniwak/iceberg.icls as a base.

### General

Generally faces python code by semantic roles, which defines system related token blue like, and class related red like, function calls yellow like, constants green like, and static data as default colors. It also mask elements that are not so important to a lower lightness. This makes easier to find the core logic in the code.
